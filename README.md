# Embedded Error State Kalman Filter

An C++ template-based Error State Kalman Filter (ESKF) implementation for embedded systems.  

This implementation is based on a header only linear algebra library [EmbeddedMath](https://github.com/geniusdo/EmbeddedMath).   
You can easily port it to Eigen-based system by simply aliasing the namespace to Eigen.
